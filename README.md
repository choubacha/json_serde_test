# json_serde_test
Mucking around with json serde

# usage
Just run with `cargo run`. There's a small struct that's mapped to serialize and it will prompt
you for your own json. Type it in and it will parse it immediately. If it fails it will provide
a the error text to you. To stop the prompt just hit enter.
